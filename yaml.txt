Yaml is represented in key value pairs
e.g. 
Fruit: Apple		
Vegetable: Carrot
Liquid: Water
Meat: chicken

A SPACE MUST BE AFTER THE COLON(:) AND BEFORE THE VALUE.

Array Representation:

Fruits:
- Orange
- Apple
- Banana

Vegetables:

- Cauliflower
- Tomato

Dictionary:

Banana:
  Calories: 105
  Fat: 0.4g
  Carbs: 27 g

Grapes:
  Calories: 62
  Fat: 0.3g
  Carbs: 16g

YOU MUST HAVE EQUAL NUMBER OF BLANK SPACES BEFORE EACH ITEM

List of Dictionaries:
Fruits:
  - Banana:
      Calories: 105
      Fat: 0.4g 
      Carbs: 27 g

  - Grapes:
      Calories: 62
      Fat: 0.3g
      Carbs: 16g

Dictionary are unordered collections; however the list is an ordered collection.
example:
    - Banana:
        Calories: 105
        Fat: 0.4g
        Carbs: 27 g

    - Banana:
        Calories: 105
        Carbs: 27 g
        Fat: 0.4g
	
Eventhough the position of carbs and fats are interchanges in the dictionary but they still hold the same value, so the both of them are equal.

But in case of list

Fruits:
- Orange
- Apple
- Banana

Fruits:
- Orange
- Banana
- Apple

are not equal because postion of item is changed.
